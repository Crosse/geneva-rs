//! This is a reimplementation of the client- and server-side rule processing mechanisms of the
//! [Geneva][geneva] project.
//!
//! Geneva is both a method to describe ways of manipulating packets to attempt to circumvent
//! censorship, and a genetic algoritmm (GENetic EVAsion) that one can deploy to discover new
//! circumventions. (This crate does not implement the genetic algorithm.) More broadly, one can
//! encode arbitrary instructions for packet manipulation using Geneva rules as a sort of "standard
//! syntax", although the use case outside of censorship circumvention may be somewhat tenuous.
//!
//! This crate aims to implement the same triggers and actions that the Geneva project's canonical
//! Python package does.
//!
//! # Quick Background
//!
//! Geneva rules are called "strategies". A strategy consists of zero or more "action trees" that can
//! be applied to inbound or outbound packets. The actions trees define both a "trigger" and a tree
//! of actions to take on a packet if the trigger matches. The result of an action tree will be zero
//! or more packets that should replace the original packet, which then can be reinjected into the
//! host OS' network stack.
//!
//! # Strategies, Forests, and Action Trees
//!
//! Let's work from the top down. A strategy, conceptually, looks like this:
//!
//!  `outbound-forest \/ inbound-forest`
//!
//! `outbound-forest` and `inbound-forest` are ordered lists of `(trigger, action tree)` pairs. The
//! Geneva paper calls these ordered lists "forests". The outbound and inbound forests are separated
//! by the `\/` characters (that is a backslash followed by a forward-slash); if the strategy omits
//! one or the other, then that side of the `\/` is left empty. For example, a strategy that only
//! includes an outbound forest would take the form `outbound \/`, whereas an inbound-only strategy
//! would be `\/ inbound`.
//!
//! The original Geneva paper does not have a name for these `(trigger, action tree)` pairs. In
//! practice, however, the Python code actually defines an action tree as a `(trigger, action)`
//! pair, where the "action" is the root of a tree of actions. This crate follows this nomenclature
//! as well.
//!
//! A real example, taken from <https://geneva.cs.umd.edu/papers/geneva_ccs19.pdf> (pg 2202), would
//! look like this:
//!
//! ```text
//!  [TCP:flags:S]-
//!      duplicate(
//!        tamper{TCP:flags:replace:SA}(send),
//!        send)-| \/
//!  [TCP:flags:R]-drop-|
//! ```
//!
//! In this example, the outbound forest would trigger on TCP packets that have just the SYN flag set,
//! and would perform a few different actions on those packets. The inbound forest would only apply
//! to TCP packets with the RST flag set, and would simply drop them. Each of the forests in the
//! example are made up of a single `(trigger, action tree)` pair.
//!
//! In a forest, each action tree must adhere to the syntax `[trigger]-action-|`.
//!
//! # Triggers
//!
//! A trigger defines a way to match packets so that an action tree can be applied to them. In the
//! example above, the first trigger is `[TCP:flags:S]`. This is a trigger that matches on the TCP
//! header's "flags" field, and requires that only the SYN flag be set. (Note that this trigger will
//! _not_ fire for packets that have, i.e., both SYN and ACK set.) If the packet is not a TCP
//! packet, or the flags do not match exactly, then this trigger will not fire.
//!
//! # Actions
//!
//! An action simply encodes steps to manipulate a packet. There are a number of actions described in
//! the Geneva paper:
//!
//! ## send
//!
//! The "send" action simply yields the given packet. (A quirk---or what the paper deems to be
//! canonical syntax---is to elide any "send" actions in the action tree. For instance, the action
//! `duplicate(,)` is equivalent to `duplicate(send,send)`. Bear this in mind when reading Geneva
//! strategies!) The syntax is:
//!
//! `send`
//!
//! ## drop
//!
//! The "drop" action discards the given packet. Like `send`, the syntax is simple:
//!
//! `drop`
//!
//! ## duplicate
//!
//! The "duplicate" action copies the original packet, then applies action `a1` to the original and
//! `a2` to the copy. For example, if `a1` and `a2` are both "send" actions, then the action will
//! yield two packets identical to the first. The syntax is:
//!
//! `duplicate(a1, a2)`
//!
//! ## fragment
//!
//! The "fragment" action takes the original packet and fragments it, applying action `a1` to one of
//! the fragments and `a2` to the other. Since both the IP and TCP layers support fragmentation, the
//! rule must specify which layer's payload to fragment. The first fragment will include up to
//! "offset" bytes of the layer's payload; the second fragment will contain the rest. As an example,
//! given an IPv4 packet with a 60-byte payload and an 8-byte offset, the first fragment will have
//! the same IP header as the original packet (aside from the fields that must be fixed) and then
//! the first eight bytes of the payload. The second fragment will contain the other 52 bytes. (You
//! can also indicate that the fragments be returned out-of-order; i.e., reversed, by specifying
//! "False" for the "inOrder" argument.) The syntax is:
//!
//! `fragment{protocol:offset:inOrder}(a1, a2)`
//!
//! ## tamper
//!
//! The "tamper" action takes the original packet and modifies it in some fashion, depending on the
//! protocol, field, and mode given. There are two modes: replace and corrupt. The "replace" mode
//! will replace the value of the given field with newValue, while the "corrupt" mode will replace
//! the value with random data. (Note that there are other modes that the Python code supports that
//! are not defined in the original Geneva paper.) The syntax is:
//!
//! `tamper{protocol:field:mode[:newValue]}(a1)`
//!
//! Additionally, note that not all actions are valid for both inbound and outbound directions. The
//! Python code mentions that "branching actions are not supported on inbound trees". Practically,
//! this means that the duplicate and fragment actions can only be applied to outbound packets, while
//! the sleep, drop, and tamper actions can apply to packets of either direction.
//!
